- [ ] Learn about HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and its role in web communication.
- [ ] (optional) Explore different types of APIs: REST, GraphQL, and gRPC.
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and their use cases.

### 2. Introduction to Python
- [x] Learn basic Python syntax and data structures.
- [ ] (optional) Study Python best practices and coding conventions (PEP 8).
- [ ] (optional) Get comfortable with virtual environments (venv) and package management (pip).

### 3. (optional) Research Python Web Frameworks
- [ ] (optional) Understand the purpose of web frameworks.
- [ ] (optional) Explore popular Python web frameworks: Flask, Django, FastAPI, and Falcon.

- [ ] Go through FastAPI's official documentation and follow the tutorial.

### 5. Set up Your First FastAPI Project (do this in sub directory of this repo)
- [ ] Create a new Python virtual environment for your project.
- [ ] Install FastAPI and an ASGI server (e.g., uvicorn) using pip.
- [ ] Create a basic FastAPI application with a simple route (e.g., a "Hello, World!" endpoint).
- [ ] Test your application locally using uvicorn.

### 6. Implement CRUD Operations
- [ ] Design a simple data model (e.g., a to-do list or a blog) for your API.
- [ ] Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using FastAPI's routing system.
- [ ] Learn how to use Pydantic for input validation and schema generation.

- [ ] (optional) Learn about JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and OAuth2.
- [ ] (optional) Implement user registration and login using FastAPI's security utilities.
- [ ] (optional) Add role-based access control to protect specific API endpoints.

### 8. API Documentation
- [ ] Learn about OpenAPI and Swagger UI.
- [ ] Explore FastAPI's automatic API documentation generation.
- [ ] Customize your API documentation with descriptions, examples, and tags.

### 9. (wait for jerome) Deployment
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with different deployment options (e.g., Heroku, AWS, GCP, or DigitalOcean).
- [ ] Choose a deployment method and follow the respective guides.
- [ ] Deploy your FastAPI application and test it on the live server.

### 10. Further Exploration (Optional)
